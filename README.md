# m3u_radios
Project will consist of m3u playlists from _public_ internet radio stations that can be used in software media players, like Kodi.
I'm mainly interested in Metal/hardrock radio stations and the main Portuguese radio stations. Later I could diversify to decade's content.
The lists, until further notice, will always be tested against Kodi using IPTV Simple and IPTV Merge addons.
For starters, I'm adding lists that are available on @Jungular 's repo
